# Noted. Sketch-to-Plot Tool

The **Sketch-to-Plot Tool** is an online platform that interprets whiteboard drawings or sketches into comprehensible data visualizations and insights. By the use of Stable Diffusion and control models, the tool scans through the sketches and produces appropriate charts or graphs from them, from jumbled-up notes to organized visual information.

## Features
- **Web Interface**: It is easy for the users to upload whiteboard sketches for processing.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes Stable Diffusion models and the API of Hugging Face to scan and extract meaningful data from the images.
- **Data Visualizations**: Converts sketches into actionable graphical representations in the form of charts and graphs.
- **Sketch-to-Chart Transformation**: Automatically creates graphs and other visualizations based on the content of the sketches.

## How It Works
1. Upload your whiteboard sketch to the web interface.
2. The system translates the sketch using AI models to understand the content.
3. The pertinent data is extracted and used to generate charts and graphs.
4. The resulting visualizations provide structured insights from your sketches.

## Technologies Used
- **Stable Diffusion Models**: For interpreting and processing sketches.
- **Hugging Face API**: For using strong AI models for data extraction and conversion.
- **Web Interface**: For easy and simple sketch uploading.
